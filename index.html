<h3>St.Augustine Beach</h3>
<h4>In September 2020 I went to St.Augustine Beach to have a getaway from the Coronavirus-19 Pamdemic and have fun finaaly after 9 months!This would be fun as during this pamdemic I never really met friends.Finaaly once I got there I started to rejoice and play with my freinds.Sadly it did not last so long and we left after 3 days.</h4>

<div class="col-lg-9 col-md-9 col-sm-9 col-xs-12"><p>Adrift in space with no food or water, Tony Stark sends a message to Pepper Potts as his oxygen supply starts to dwindle. Meanwhile, the remaining Avengers -- Thor, Black Widow, Captain America and Bruce Banner -- must figure out a way to bring back their vanquished allies for an epic showdown with Thanos -- the evil demigod who decimated the planet and the universe.I give it 4 stars becuase I feel that Tony Stark did not have to die and depress Mrs.Stark and their daugther as well as the entire crew but overall if Tony Stark had not died it would be a 9 and also why do you need a new Captain America?It is mean to the original and he is the best as he faced Hitler,Thanos,and Red Face(the creppy one who I don't think that is his his name),etc.</p></div>
